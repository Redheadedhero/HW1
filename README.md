Part A I took the time to figure out how to import a blender object into the scence and making a "trophy" out of it
Part B I canged the effect on the various red, blue and green channels giving it an interesting orange-brown and blue-grey transition before the blur takes effect. This also adds the illustion of the image moving like a holographic card.
